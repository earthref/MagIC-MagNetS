Space weather is a relative newcomer to the world of natural hazards as it affects our technology, rather having a direct impact on us. However, as our reliance on technology grows ever stronger it is becoming more and more important to understand the causes and effects of space weather so that we can mitigate against them. Geomagnetic storms can lead to damage to ground based technological infrastructure, such as power grids, pipelines and railways, and so have the potential to be incredibly disruptive to our daily lives. In this talk I will give an overview of space weather forecasting and research and describe some of the work we are doing to help understand how geomagnetically induced currents affect technology.

Some people had a misspent youth. I waited until I was an adult and spent it studying the magnetism of mud. In seeking highly resolved records of geomagnetic field, tectonic, or climate change, I learned early that diagenesis affects EVERY record. The question is not one of “if” diagenesis has affected a record, but “by how much?” Diagenesis colours my view of sedimentary magnetism at a deep level. OK, but what does this have to do with magnetotactic bacteria (MTB)? The dominant view of MTB is that they are ubiquitous in aquatic environments and that they inhabit chemical gradients across the oxic-anoxic interface in water columns and sediments. OAI environments are where diagenesis starts to become important, so my expectation for 20 years was that, while MTB are interesting organisms, they should not be important in the geological record because their post-mortem remains (magnetofossils) would be buried in environments dominated by reductive diagenesis, which would cause them to dissolve and not be preserved. Various other MTB curiosities intrigued me, but I did not care enough about exploring them if magnetofossils were not paleomagnetically or paleoenvironmentally important. About 10 years ago, my views turned on their head when we and other groups started to find evidence for widespread magnetofossil preservation in some ancient sedimentary environment types. This raises questions about the environments in which MTB lived. Do MTB always inhabit OAI environments? What is the environmental function of MTB? What is the benefit of magnetic navigation, or magnetotaxis? Are MTB involved in biogeochemical elemental cycling? Can magnetofossil morphology tell us anything useful about the environment? Can it be used as a paleoenvironmental proxy? We expect from their single domain magnetic properties that magnetofossils will be ideal paleomagnetic recorders, but what happens to things like relative paleointensity (RPI) recording when magnetofossils and detrital magnetite occur together? Do they have the same or different magnetization acquisition efficiency? If not, what does this mean for RPI recording? When did MTB appear in geological time? Can this tell us anything about evolution of the geodynamo that generate our planetary magnetic field? Much has been learned about these questions in recent years. My aim is to tell you about some of the exciting things we have been learning about MTB and point to some exciting unanswered questions. Let’s misspend an hour together exploring this subject.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
Archeomagnetic analyses of densely sampled artefacts from the Near-East have suggested that the intensity variation during the first millennium BCE was punctuated with two geomagnetic spikes with rates of change of intensity exceeding 1 μT/yr, whose extreme behaviour is challenging to explain from a geodynamo perspective. I will describe a new transdimensional Bayesian method designed to capture variations on both long and short timescales, which when applied to data only at the fragment (thermal- unit) level requires a complex intensity variation with no less than six spikes, each with an approximate duration of between 30 and 100 years. However, the nature of the inferred intensity evolution and the number of spikes detected are fragile and highly dependent on the specific treatment of the archeomagnetic data.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
The anisotropic properties of a formation’s pore space largely control preferred flow directions. An accurate 3D description of pore space properties is thus essential in reservoir characterization and fluid migration studies. Traditional characterization methods face trade-offs between sample volume and resolution amongst other challenges. Magnetic pore fabrics, i.e., the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility in ferrofluid-impregnated samples, have been proposed to capture pores down to 10 nm in standard-sized samples. Promising empirical relationships exist between magnetic pore fabrics and pore shape and orientation distributions, but are compromised by a large variability between studies. New numerical and experimental data provide insight into the sources of this variability, and allow for a quantitative interpretation of magnetic pore fabrics in future applications.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
Paleointensity data suggest the presence of a lunar dynamo with a surface intensity reaching tens of µT during the period 4.25 to 3.56 Ga and subsequently declining to several µT during the following ~2 billion years. However, the lunar energy budget does not appear to be able to continuously power such a strong dynamo for so long. A proposed solution to this conundrum is that the lunar dynamo was in fact highly time-variable or even intermittently active during this period. However, until now, there has been no Thellier paleointensity data from Apollo lunar samples to support a time-variable dynamo. Using our newly developed oxygen fugacity controlled atmosphere thermal demagnetizer, we report new paleointensity data from lunar regolith breccias showing near-zero (< 0.5 µT) paleointensity at 3.3 ± 0.43 Ga and at 1.7 ± 0.43 Ga. This supports the proposal that the average field may have been significantly weaker than implied by the highest paleointensities, consistent with the expected energy budget for the lunar core.

Understanding how magnetic minerals are formed in archaeological ceramics and baked clay is crucial for assessing the reliability of archaeointensity determinations, and could also contribute to reconstructing the ceramics manufacture process. Magnetic minerals in archaeological ceramics and baked clay may be inherited from the parent material, or, more frequently, formed during the firing process. The resulting magnetic mineralogy may be complex, including ferrimagnetic phases not commonly encountered in rocks.
In this talk, I will review the current understanding of magnetic mineralogy of archaeological ceramics and baked clay using the material from Bulgaria and Russia as an example.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
Recent paleomagnetic studies of lunar rocks have suggested that the Moon's magnetic field reached peak intensities on the order of ~77 μT between 3.85 and 3.56 Ga and subsequently declined to surface intensities of ~4  μT by 3.19 Ga. However, this decline in the intensity of the lunar field has only been shown in a small number of samples, presenting challenges for constraint of its timing and thus the dynamo generation mechanisms that could be responsible. We present microscopic and magnetic analyses of Apollo samples 12008, 12009, and 12015, three fine grained mare vitrophyre basalts with high magnetic fidelity, indicating that these samples were not magnetized in conditions consistent with a planetary magnetic field exceeding 4-7  μT during their formation. These data are consistent with the results of previous work on the initial decline of Moon's magnetic field and confirm that the mechanism of lunar dynamo generation changed dramatically between 3.6 and 3.1 Ga.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
The theory for recording of thermally blocked remanences predicts a quasilinear relationship between low fields like the Earth's in which rocks cool and acquire a magnetization. This serves as the foundation for estimating ancient magnetic field strengths. Addressing long-standing questions concerning Earth's magnetic field requires a global paleointensity data set, but recovering the ancient field strength is complicated because the theory only pertains to uniformly magnetized particles. A key requirement of a paleointensity experiment is that a magnetization blocked at a given temperature should be unblocked by zero-field reheating to the same temperature. However, failure of this requirement occurs frequently and the causes and consequences of failure are understood incompletely. Recent experiments demonstrate that the remanence in many samples typical of those used in paleointensity experiments is unstable, exhibiting an “aging” effect in which the (un)blocking temperature spectra can change over only a few years resulting in nonideal experimental behavior. While a fresh remanence may conform to the requirement of equality of blocking and unblocking temperatures, aged remanences may not. Blocking temperature spectra can be unstable (fragile), which precludes reproduction of the conditions under which the original magnetization was acquired. This limits our ability to acquire accurate and precise ancient magnetic field strength estimates because differences between known and estimated fields can be significant for individual specimens, with a low field bias. Fragility of unblocking temperature spectra may be related to grain sizes with lower energy barriers and may be detected by features observed in first-order reversal curves.

Baked clay archaeological material and volcanic rocks offer precious information about the Secular Variation of the Earth’s magnetic field in the past thanks to their strong and stable Thermal Remanent Magnetization (TRM) acquired during their cooling in the presence of the ancient geomagnetic field. Italy is a country with great potential for archaeomagnetic research due to its long and rich cultural heritage and to the important volcanic activity of the two principal active Italian volcanoes, Vesuvius and Etna. Recently, an updated compilation of Italian archaeomagnetic data from both archaeological material and volcanic rocks has been compiled and used for the calculation of directional and intensity reference secular variation (SV) curves. The quality of the data was carefully evaluated, with particular attention on the reliability of the dating of the volcanic rocks and on the quality of the archaeointensity determinations. Revising the reliability of the historical dating of the available volcanic data, it results that only 57% of the volcanic palaeomagnetic records come from indisputably dated eruptions while for the rest of the data, the traditional age of the eruption has been subject of debate or re-evaluated based on geological evidence and/or archaeomagnetic dating. New SV curves for both direction and intensity are now available for Italy, calculated using Bayesian statistics and covering the last three millennia. Thanks to the privileged geographical position of the Italian peninsula, situated almost in the center of the Mediterranean, the Italian SV curves can be used to analyze the evolution of the geomagnetic field in central Europe and for archaeomagnetic dating applications not only in Italy but also in nearby countries where no local SV curves are available so far. Definitely, more well-dated reference data are still necessary to better define the geomagnetic field path for the BC periods while future attention should be also focused on the archaeointensity data that are still scarce.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
Paleomagnetic data are crucial to understand the dynamical behavior of the geomagnetic field since they provide the unique way to investigate past changes in the Earth’s magnetic field. Two new global geomagnetic field reconstructions, the SHAWQ-Iron Age and the SHAWQ2k, based on a critical revision of the global archeomagnetic and volcanic dataset, have been developed. The new models provide an improved description of the geomagnetic field during the last three millennia and yield interesting outcomes about the emergence and development of the Levantine Iron Age Anomaly (LIAA) and the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA). According to the SHAWQ-Iron Age, the LIAA is related to a normal flux patch at the core-mantle boundary (CMB) below Arabian Peninsula clearly observed at around 950 BC. This flux patch expanded towards the north-west, while decreasing in intensity, reaching Iberia at around 750 BC. Around 600-500 BC, it underwent a revival below the European continent after that it seems to vanish in situ. Regarding the SHAWQ2k, it shows that the reversed flux patch observed at the CMB and linked to the SAA in present times, emerged in the Southern Hemisphere from at least 950 AD. This patch moved westward from the equator to southern latitudes, being clearly isolated after 1400 AD. In addition, since 1550 AD a second reversed flux patch moving north-eastward is observed in the North Atlantic. As can be observed from these works, our understanding of past geomagnetic field behavior has improved thanks to: 1) the new data now available for the Southern Hemisphere coming from Africa and South America, 2) the new data coming from the Iberian Peninsula prior to Late Iron Age times, an epoch very poorly constrained up to date, and 3) the use of an appropriated weighting scheme in the modeling process, which takes into account quality standards especially relevant in paleointensity studies. These improvements have allowed to show new evolutionary aspects of the both LIAA and SAA.

Cretaceous-Paleogene marine units from the James Ross Basin constitute a highly fossiliferous reference section for the Southern Hemisphere. Its importance resides not only in the widely known K-Pg boundary at Marambio (Seymour) Island, but also in its almost continuous record of climate and biodiversity patterns preceding and following the terminal Cretaceous mass extinction. Chronology of these units has been traditionally based on bio- and chemostratigraphy, but endemism and early disappearance of several fossil groups in Antarctica requires an independent dating tool that also permits global correlations. Here I present a synthesis of recent magnetostratigraphic studies realized in the Upper Cretaceous Marambio Group, summarizing a chronostratigraphic framework that precisely states the Santonian-Campanian and Campanian-Maastrichtian boundaries in Antarctica.

Understanding hydrocarbon migration has the potential to both increase yield from mature reservoir systems reducing the need to exploit new reserves, and to help improve carbon capture strategies. Traditional seismic methods of mapping migration can be inexact and poorly constrained. The presence of hydrocarbons in rocks and sediments is known to cause diagenesis, thereby altering the magnetic signature of the host rock. During the last decade, the Natural Magnetism Group at Imperial College has been studying the use of mineral magnetic methods to identify and constrain hydrocarbon migration paths. The magnetic signature of hydrocarbons has been found to be very complex, their signature depending on a range of factors including levels of oil maturity and biodegradation, the presence of oil-water contacts, the host rock, migration trajectory, the depth of oil generation etc. Here I will give a summary of our latest findings, and show how we have used mineral magnetic results to constrain 3D basin models.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
Earth's magnetic field is presently characterized by a large and growing anomaly in the South Atlantic Ocean. The question of whether this region of Earth's surface is preferentially subject to enhanced geomagnetic variability on geological timescales has major implications for core dynamics, core−mantle interaction, and the possibility of an imminent magnetic polarity reversal. Here we present paleomagnetic data from Saint Helena, a volcanic island ideally suited for testing the hypothesis that geomagnetic field behavior is anomalous in the South Atlantic on timescales of millions of years. Our results, supported by positive baked contact and reversal tests, produce a mean direction approximating that expected from a geocentric axial dipole for the interval 8 to 11 million years ago, but with very large associated directional dispersion. These findings indicate that, on geological timescales, geomagnetic secular variation is persistently enhanced in the vicinity of Saint Helena. This, in turn, supports the South Atlantic as a locus of unusual geomagnetic behavior arising from core−mantle interaction, while also appearing to reduce the likelihood that the present-day regional anomaly is a precursor to a global polarity reversal.

High quality paleointensity data is essential for improving our understanding of the long-term evolution of the geodynamo as well as short-term paleosecular variation; however, it is challenging to find materials that reliably record Earth's full-vector magnetic field going back in time. This study examines a new candidate material for paleointensity studies: clinkers, which are rocks that have been baked, metamorphosed, or melted by underlying coal seam fires. Previous studies conducted on clinkers suggest that they may be high-fidelity magnetic field recorders. However, due to the inhomogeneity of clinker deposits and limited scope of previous studies, it is unknown under what conditions these conclusions hold true. To better assess this, we quantified the variation of magnetic properties within clinker deposits collected from the Powder River basin, MT, as a function of lithology, oxidation state, distance from the coal seam, and location. Our results indicate that the clinker products are dominated by three main magnetic minerals: magnetite, hematite, and the rare ε-Fe2O3. No major differences in magnetic properties were observed as a function of location, distance from the coal seam, or primary lithology. Clinker material, instead, is the primary control on magnetic mineralogy, where baked sediment and porcellanite are dominated by varying proportions of hematite, ε-Fe2O3, and magnetite, and paralavas (melted sediment) are dominated by low-Ti magnetite. All clinker materials are thermally stable and likely experienced temperatures in excess of the magnetite Curie T, potentially as far away as 8 m from the coal seam. Grain size analysis indicates that the magnetic particles in all clinker materials are amenable to high-quality paleointensity study. In total, our study confirms that clinkers should be reliable paleomagnetic recorders and that so long as collection is within the clinker deposit, material amenable to full-vector paleomagnetic study should be obtained.  These conclusion are corroborated by preliminary demagnetization and paleointensity results, which will also be presented.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
The Swarm constellation provides information on both along- and across-track magnetic field gradients. Spatial changes of the magnetic vector field elements are described by a magnetic field gradient tensor, whose elements and their uncertainties can be estimated using the Virtual Observatory (VO) concept, whereby data within a cylinder centred on the VO with axis perpendicular to the Earth's surface are reduced to a central point at satellite altitude. Recent experiments have shown that analysing data collected over a 4 month window provides the best compromise between reducing bias from the way the satellite orbits sample each VO cylinder and preserving information on temporal changes of the field, and that the data provide spatial information sufficient to resolve 300 non-overlapping VOs. We invert annual first differences of the 5 independent gradient tensor elements (providing estimates of secular variation, SV, gradients) at these 300 VOs over the Swarm era for advective velocity at the core-mantle boundary, forcing the flow to have minimal acceleration while providing an adequate fit to the data. We obtain flows similar to those from previous SV inversions but purely from the gradient information. The resolution of the SV gradients is higher than that of the SV itself, resulting in a ~30% increase in the number of effective flow parameters; this is thought to be because the gradients are less affected by long period external signals that are difficult to remove from the data, resulting in an improved signal to noise ratio. Although very little temporal change in the flow is required to reproduce even rapid changes in the magnetic field, we are able to isolate some robust flow changes, in particular regarding changes in the azimuthal flow acceleration, associated with the geomagnetic impulse in the Pacific region in around 2016.

**15 July 2020** - "First Late Quaternary PSV curve from Scotland, UK"  
Author: **Myriam Rada Torres** (University of Edinburgh, UK)  
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
I present the first Late Quaternary PSV record for Scotland and the UK, covering the last 19,000 years, generated using sediment cores from Bardowie Loch in the Central Belt of Scotland. This is also the first study that describes the variations of the geomagnetic field both in direction and intensity during The Holocene for Scotland, representing a valuable piece for the puzzle of the geodynamo behaviour in the North Atlantic region.
Bardowie Loch was selected based on its small-size basin and limited catchment area, devoid of any sizeable river system, ensuring a low energy environment necessary for the magnetic minerals to align with the Earth's magnetic field. Geological analysis results suggest that Bardowie Loch was originated by the movement of large glaciers during the Last Glacial Maximum at ca 20ka. Rock magnetic characterisations, supported by microscopic and geochemical analyses, shows two distinctive sedimentary sections within the Bardowie Sequence: glacial varved muds overlied by dark organic muds. These results also indicate that for the Late Pleistocene glacial section there are pulses of substantial deposition of sediments eroded from nearby Palaeozoic basaltic lavas, rich in magnetite and Ti-magnetite grains. A thousand percent surge in organic matter content, combined with a considerable decrease of the volcanic rocks input and significantly lower concentration of magnetic minerals, characterised the Holocene section of the Bardowie Sequence.
A chronology was modelled using 15 radiocarbon dates and tephrochronology. Geochemical results indicate that the deeper tephra layer is a rhyolite with high iron, calcium and titanium content characteristic of Icelandic volcanism, corresponding to the Hekla 4 Eruption (ca 2,000 BC). EPMA measurements from the upper two layers show chemical compositions typical of a developed continental crust with high concentration of alkaline oxides, characteristic of the Campanian Volcanic Province (Italy); major oxides composition determined from microscopic glasses and mineral inclusions revealed that the first layer is a rare phonolitic tephra corresponding to the historical 79AD Pompeii Eruption; while the second layer has an alkaline intermediate composition (trachyandesite), which agrees with the Avellino Eruption dated between 1,900BC and 1,600BC.
Previous PSV studies from North America, the North Atlantic region, Northern Europe and England are consistent with direct observations and computational models of two regions of concentrated geomagnetic flux at the core-mantle boundary beneath Canada and Siberia, which suggest that the Canadian flux lobe has been weakening while the Siberian flux lobe has considerably increased in strength for the last 2,000 years. The declination and palaeointensity anomalies observed in the present PSV study from Scotland particularly agree with the North Atlantic region data, showing significant oscillations in strength between both flux lobes at least for the last 5,000 years.
The Late Pleistocene section of the resulting PSV record from Scotland shows two intervals of exceptional deviation in direction at ca 18.3ka to ca 16ka and ca 15ka to ca 12.8ka. The deepest interval displays anomalous shallow inclinations around 20°, joined by the largest oscillation in declination, with a maximum of 77-degree deviation. Such substantial variations in the geomagnetic field orientation agree with the Hilina Palli Excursion, dated between 22ka and 17ka and observed globally in volcanic rocks, marine and lake cores from Hawaii and California, to Lake Baikal and China.
The upper interval of anomalous geomagnetic field behaviour close to the end of The Pleistocene, exhibits the largest drop of inclination from present-day values (about 70°) to negative inclinations (-12°), while the declination presents oscillations over 50-degrees. These abrupt and dramatic variations in orientation are consistent with the controversial Gothenburg Excursion (ca 12.3 to ca 13.8ka), which were originally reported in sediments from the Scandinavian Glacial Interstadial and also observed in North American glacial lakes, with poorly constrained ages from 7.6ka to 14ka.

The geomagnetic field can vary dramatically over only decades and thousands of kilometers; the Levantine Iron Age geomagnetic Anomaly (LIAA) is probably the best-known example of such short-lived feature of the Earth's magnetic field. Over the past decade, many studies have contributed to a relatively coherent intensity record for this region. I will provide an overview of the different studies and their results with the focus on our recent study on three marine sediment records from the Mediterranean Sea. To better constrain the Levant geomagnetic high in time and space, we obtained continuous full-vector records from three marine sediment cores located (1) between Spain and Morocco (Alboran), (2) East of Calabria, Italy (Taranto Gulf), and (3) North of the Nile Delta (Levant). Geomagnetic field variations between 6000 BC and 1000 AD are captured for a total of 681 samples. Rock magnetic analyses indicate the sediment cores as reliable recorders for geomagnetic field variations. From these records we observe that the LIAA moves from 40 to 55° East at 1000 BC to ~25° East at 0 AD, while decaying from ~150 ZAm<sup>2</sup> to ~110 ZAm<sup>2</sup> in the same time span. This results in a westward movement of 15-30° in 1000 yr.

**17 June 2020** - "Micromagnetic modeling of silicate-hosted magnetic inclusions using SEM-FIB slice-and-view nanotomography"  
Author: **Even Nikolaisen** (Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway)  
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
Slice-and-view nanotomography uses a dual beam SEM-FIB to reconstruct the 3D volume of a mineralogical sample using a sequential series of nanoscale slices created with a focussed beam of Ga ions. This method reveals the true shapes and forms of naturally occurring magnetic inclusions hosted by the silicate minerals feldspar and pyroxene. High-resolution 3D morphological data for the magnetic minerals is extracted, converted to tetrahedral meshes, and micromagnetically modelled using the MERRILL software. This study optimises the step-by-step process of extracting and processing micromagnetic data from polished thin-sections to generate a full rock magnetic classification of the remanence carriers in silicates. Slice-and-view nanotomography follows known preparation methods with a protective platinum layer, carbon rod guides and trenches, but also introduces a carbon slab along the Z-direction for e-beam alignment. This method reduces the need for auto focus, as the e-beam alignment will have a constant imaging distance and generates a good reference point for stack alignment. Image processing is limited to 3D a gaussian blur and 3D mean filters. Paraview is used to set the correct voxel dimensions and to generate the surface mesh. Freeware software Meshmixer and Meshlab are used for their powerful smoothing, mesh interaction tools and geometric calculations. The tetrahedral volume mesh is produced with iso2mesh in Matlab. Micromagnetic hysteresis and back-field simulations of >400 inclusions with a broad range of morphologies have been performed using MERRILL using 20 different field directions, enabling average magnetic properties to be calculated for a random ensemble. The results give a detailed and direct description of the micromagnetic structure of naturally formed magnetic minerals that compliments macroscopic approaches, such as FORC analysis.

**3 June 2020** - "Rapid geomagnetic changes inferred from Earth observations and numerical simulations"  
Author: **Chris Davies** (University of Leeds, UK)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
The geomagnetic field, generated by a dynamo process in the liquid core, provides a unique probe into Earth's deep interior. Establishing the fastest variations of the field is crucial for understanding the physics of the dynamo process and for describing its past and future evolution. Paleomagnetic studies have reported changes in direction reaching 1 degree per yr around the last polarity reversal, although the observations are still controversial and their relation to physical processes in the core largely unknown. Here we show excellent agreement between amplitudes and latitude ranges of extreme directional changes in a suite of geodynamo simulations and recent observational field models spanning the past 100 kyrs and the period 30-50 ka. Remarkably, maximum rates of directional change reach ~10 degrees per year, typically during times of decreasing field strength,almost 100 times faster than current changes. Detailed analysis of the simulations and a simple analogue model indicate that extreme directional changes are associated with movement of reversed flux across the core surface. Our results demonstrate that such rapid variations are compatible with the physics of the dynamo process and suggest that future searches for rapid directional changes should focus on low latitudes.
