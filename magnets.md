2020-09-23 - "Coniacia-Danian chronostratigraphy of the James Ross Basin: a synthesis"  
Author: **Florenzia Milanese** (Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina)
 <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cretaceous-Paleogene marine units from the James Ross Basin constitute a highly fossiliferous reference section for the Southern Hemisphere. Its importance resides not only in the widely known K-Pg boundary at Marambio (Seymour) Island, but also in its almost continuous record of climate and biodiversity patterns preceding and following the terminal Cretaceous mass extinction. Chronology of these units has been traditionally based on bio- and chemostratigraphy, but endemism and early disappearance of several fossil groups in Antarctica requires an independent dating tool that also permits global correlations. Here I present a synthesis of recent magnetostratigraphic studies realized in the Upper Cretaceous Marambio Group, summarizing a chronostratigraphic framework that precisely states the Santonian-Campanian and Campanian-Maastrichtian boundaries in Antarctica.

2020-09-09 - "Diagenesis and the magnetic signature of hydrocarbons"  
Author: **Adrian Muxworthy** (Imperial College of London, UK)  
 <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
Understanding hydrocarbon migration has the potential to both increase yield from mature reservoir systems reducing the need to exploit new reserves, and to help improve carbon capture strategies. Traditional seismic methods of mapping migration can be inexact and poorly constrained. The presence of hydrocarbons in rocks and sediments is known to cause diagenesis, thereby altering the magnetic signature of the host rock. During the last decade, the Natural Magnetism Group at Imperial College has been studying the use of mineral magnetic methods to identify and constrain hydrocarbon migration paths. The magnetic signature of hydrocarbons has been found to be very complex, their signature depending on a range of factors including levels of oil maturity and biodegradation, the presence of oil-water contacts, the host rock, migration trajectory, the depth of oil generation etc. Here I will give a summary of our latest findings, and show how we have used mineral magnetic results to constrain 3D basin models.

2020-08-26 - "Recurring anomalous magnetic field behavior in the South Atlantic on multi-million year timescales"  
 Author: **Yael Engbers** (University of Liverpool, UK)  
 <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Earth’s magnetic field is presently characterized by a large and growing anomaly in the South Atlantic Ocean. The question of whether this region of Earth’s surface is preferentially subject to enhanced geomagnetic variability on geological timescales has major implications for core dynamics, core−mantle interaction, and the possibility of an imminent magnetic polarity reversal. Here we present paleomagnetic data from Saint Helena, a volcanic island ideally suited for testing the hypothesis that geomagnetic field behavior is anomalous in the South Atlantic on timescales of millions of years. Our results, supported by positive baked contact and reversal tests, produce a mean direction approximating that expected from a geocentric axial dipole for the interval 8 to 11 million years ago, but with very large associated directional dispersion. These findings indicate that, on geological timescales, geomagnetic secular variation is persistently enhanced in the vicinity of Saint Helena. This, in turn, supports the South Atlantic as a locus of unusual geomagnetic behavior arising from core−mantle interaction, while also appearing to reduce the likelihood that the present-day regional anomaly is a precursor to a global polarity reversal.

2020-08-12 - "Landscapes on Fire: Do rocks baked by coal seam fires reliably record the geomagnetic field?"  
 Author: **Courtney Sprain** (University of Florida, USA)  
 <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    High quality paleointensity data is essential for improving our understanding of the long-term evolution of the geodynamo as well as short-term paleosecular variation; however, it is challenging to find materials that reliably record Earth’s full-vector magnetic field going back in time. This study examines a new candidate material for paleointensity studies: clinkers, which are rocks that have been baked, metamorphosed, or melted by underlying coal seam fires. Previous studies conducted on clinkers suggest that they may be high-fidelity magnetic field recorders. However, due to the inhomogeneity of clinker deposits and limited scope of previous studies, it is unknown under what conditions these conclusions hold true. To better assess this, we quantified the variation of magnetic properties within clinker deposits collected from the Powder River basin, MT, as a function of lithology, oxidation state, distance from the coal seam, and location. Our results indicate that the clinker products are dominated by three main magnetic minerals: magnetite, hematite, and the rare ε-Fe2O3. No major differences in magnetic properties were observed as a function of location, distance from the coal seam, or primary lithology. Clinker material, instead, is the primary control on magnetic mineralogy, where baked sediment and porcellanite are dominated by varying proportions of hematite, ε-Fe2O3, and magnetite, and paralavas (melted sediment) are dominated by low-Ti magnetite. All clinker materials are thermally stable and likely experienced temperatures in excess of the magnetite Curie T, potentially as far away as 8 m from the coal seam. Grain size analysis indicates that the magnetic particles in all clinker materials are amenable to high-quality paleointensity study. In total, our study confirms that clinkers should be reliable paleomagnetic recorders and that so long as collection is within the clinker deposit, material amenable to full-vector paleomagnetic study should be obtained.  These conclusion are corroborated by preliminary demagnetization and paleointensity results, which will also be presented.

2020-07-29 - "The 2016 Pacific jerk and core-mantle boundary flows obtained purely from Swarm secular variation gradient information"  
Author: **Kathy Whaler** (University of Edinburgh, UK)  
 <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    The Swarm constellation provides information on both along- and across-track magnetic field gradients. Spatial changes of the magnetic vector field elements are described by a magnetic field gradient tensor, whose elements and their uncertainties can be estimated using the Virtual Observatory (VO) concept, whereby data within a cylinder centred on the VO with axis perpendicular to the Earth’s surface are reduced to a central point at satellite altitude. Recent experiments have shown that analysing data collected over a 4 month window provides the best compromise between reducing bias from the way the satellite orbits sample each VO cylinder and preserving information on temporal changes of the field, and that the data provide spatial information sufficient to resolve 300 non-overlapping VOs. We invert annual first differences of the 5 independent gradient tensor elements (providing estimates of secular variation, SV, gradients) at these 300 VOs over the Swarm era for advective velocity at the core-mantle boundary, forcing the flow to have minimal acceleration while providing an adequate fit to the data. We obtain flows similar to those from previous SV inversions but purely from the gradient information. The resolution of the SV gradients is higher than that of the SV itself, resulting in a ~30% increase in the number of effective flow parameters; this is thought to be because the gradients are less affected by long period external signals that are difficult to remove from the data, resulting in an improved signal to noise ratio. Although very little temporal change in the flow is required to reproduce even rapid changes in the magnetic field, we are able to isolate some robust flow changes, in particular regarding changes in the azimuthal flow acceleration, associated with the geomagnetic impulse in the Pacific region in around 2016.

2020-07-15 - "First Late Quaternary PSV curve from Scotland, UK"  
 Author: **Myriam Rada Torres** (University of Edinburgh, UK)  
 <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    I present the first Late Quaternary PSV record for Scotland and the UK, covering the last 19,000 years, generated using sediment cores from Bardowie Loch in the Central Belt of Scotland. This is also the first study that describes the variations of the geomagnetic field both in direction and intensity during The Holocene for Scotland, representing a valuable piece for the puzzle of the geodynamo behaviour in the North Atlantic region.
Bardowie Loch was selected based on its small-size basin and limited catchment area, devoid of any sizeable river system, ensuring a low energy environment necessary for the magnetic minerals to align with the Earth’s magnetic field. Geological analysis results suggest that Bardowie Loch was originated by the movement of large glaciers during the Last Glacial Maximum at ca 20ka. Rock magnetic characterisations, supported by microscopic and geochemical analyses, shows two distinctive sedimentary sections within the Bardowie Sequence: glacial varved muds overlied by dark organic muds. These results also indicate that for the Late Pleistocene glacial section there are pulses of substantial deposition of sediments eroded from nearby Palaeozoic basaltic lavas, rich in magnetite and Ti-magnetite grains. A thousand percent surge in organic matter content, combined with a considerable decrease of the volcanic rocks input and significantly lower concentration of magnetic minerals, characterised the Holocene section of the Bardowie Sequence.
A chronology was modelled using 15 radiocarbon dates and tephrochronology. Geochemical results indicate that the deeper tephra layer is a rhyolite with high iron, calcium and titanium content characteristic of Icelandic volcanism, corresponding to the Hekla 4 Eruption (ca 2,000 BC). EPMA measurements from the upper two layers show chemical compositions typical of a developed continental crust with high concentration of alkaline oxides, characteristic of the Campanian Volcanic Province (Italy); major oxides composition determined from microscopic glasses and mineral inclusions revealed that the first layer is a rare phonolitic tephra corresponding to the historical 79AD Pompeii Eruption; while the second layer has an alkaline intermediate composition (trachyandesite), which agrees with the Avellino Eruption dated between 1,900BC and 1,600BC.
Previous PSV studies from North America, the North Atlantic region, Northern Europe and England are consistent with direct observations and computational models of two regions of concentrated geomagnetic flux at the core-mantle boundary beneath Canada and Siberia, which suggest that the Canadian flux lobe has been weakening while the Siberian flux lobe has considerably increased in strength for the last 2,000 years. The declination and palaeointensity anomalies observed in the present PSV study from Scotland particularly agree with the North Atlantic region data, showing significant oscillations in strength between both flux lobes at least for the last 5,000 years.
The Late Pleistocene section of the resulting PSV record from Scotland shows two intervals of exceptional deviation in direction at ca 18.3ka to ca 16ka and ca 15ka to ca 12.8ka. The deepest interval displays anomalous shallow inclinations around 20º, joined by the largest oscillation in declination, with a maximum of 77-degree deviation. Such substantial variations in the geomagnetic field orientation agree with the Hilina Palli Excursion, dated between 22ka and 17ka and observed globally in volcanic rocks, marine and lake cores from Hawaii and California, to Lake Baikal and China.
The upper interval of anomalous geomagnetic field behaviour close to the end of The Pleistocene, exhibits the largest drop of inclination from present-day values (about 70º) to negative inclinations (-12º), while the declination presents oscillations over 50-degrees. These abrupt and dramatic variations in orientation are consistent with the controversial Gothenburg Excursion (ca 12.3 to ca 13.8ka), which were originally reported in sediments from the Scandinavian Glacial Interstadial and also observed in North American glacial lakes, with poorly constrained ages from 7.6ka to 14ka.

 2020-07-01 - "The evolution of the Levantine Iron Age geomagnetic Anomaly"  
 Author: **Annemarieke Béguin** (Utrecht University, The Netherlands)  
 <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    The geomagnetic field can vary dramatically over only decades and thousands of kilometers; the Levantine Iron Age geomagnetic Anomaly (LIAA) is probably the best-known example of such short-lived feature of the Earth’s magnetic field. Over the past decade, many studies have contributed to a relatively coherent intensity record for this region. I will provide an overview of the different studies and their results with the focus on our recent study on three marine sediment records from the Mediterranean Sea. To better constrain the Levant geomagnetic high in time and space, we obtained continuous full-vector records from three marine sediment cores located (1) between Spain and Morocco (Alboran), (2) East of Calabria, Italy (Taranto Gulf), and (3) North of the Nile Delta (Levant). Geomagnetic field variations between 6000 BC and 1000 AD are captured for a total of 681 samples. Rock magnetic analyses indicate the sediment cores as reliable recorders for geomagnetic field variations. From these records we observe that the LIAA moves from 40 to 55° East at 1000 BC to ∼25° East at 0 AD, while decaying from ∼150 ZAm2 to ∼110 ZAm2 in the same time span. This results in a westward movement of 15–30° in 1000 yr.

 2020-06-17 - "Micromagnetic modeling of silicate-hosted magnetic inclusions using SEM-FIB slice-and-view nanotomography"  
 Author: **Even Nikolaisen** (Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway)  
 <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Slice-and-view nanotomography uses a dual beam SEM-FIB to reconstruct the 3D volume of a mineralogical sample using a sequential series of nanoscale slices created with a focussed beam of Ga ions. This method reveals the true shapes and forms of naturally occurring magnetic inclusions hosted by the silicate minerals feldspar and pyroxene. High-resolution 3D morphological data for the magnetic minerals is extracted, converted to tetrahedral meshes, and micromagnetically modelled using the MERRILL software. This study optimises the step-by-step process of extracting and processing micromagnetic data from polished thin-sections to generate a full rock magnetic classification of the remanence carriers in silicates. Slice-and-view nanotomography follows known preparation methods with a protective platinum layer, carbon rod guides and trenches, but also introduces a carbon slab along the Z-direction for e-beam alignment. This method reduces the need for auto focus, as the e-beam alignment will have a constant imaging distance and generates a good reference point for stack alignment. Image processing is limited to 3D a gaussian blur and 3D mean filters. Paraview is used to set the correct voxel dimensions and to generate the surface mesh. Freeware software Meshmixer and Meshlab are used for their powerful smoothing, mesh interaction tools and geometric calculations. The tetrahedral volume mesh is produced with iso2mesh in Matlab. Micromagnetic hysteresis and back-field simulations of >400 inclusions with a broad range of morphologies have been performed using MERRILL using 20 different field directions, enabling average magnetic properties to be calculated for a random ensemble. The results give a detailed and direct description of the micromagnetic structure of naturally formed magnetic minerals that compliments macroscopic approaches, such as FORC analysis.

 2020-06-03 - "Rapid geomagnetic changes inferred from Earth observations and numerical simulations"  
 Author: **Chris Davies** (University of Leeds, UK)  
 <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    The geomagnetic field, generated by a dynamo process in the liquid core, provides a unique probe into Earth's deep interior. Establishing the fastest variations of the field is crucial for understanding the physics of the dynamo process and for describing its past and future evolution. Paleomagnetic studies have reported changes in direction reaching 1 degree per yr around the last polarity reversal, although the observations are still controversial and their relation to physical processes in the core largely unknown. Here we show excellent agreement between amplitudes and latitude ranges of extreme directional changes in a suite of geodynamo simulations and recent observational field models spanning the past 100 kyrs and the period 30-50 ka. Remarkably, maximum rates of directional change reach ~10 degrees per year, typically during times of decreasing field strength,almost 100 times faster than current changes. Detailed analysis of the simulations and a simple analogue model indicate that extreme directional changes are associated with movement of reversed flux across the core surface. Our results demonstrate that such rapid variations are compatible with the physics of the dynamo process and suggest that future searches for rapid directional changes should focus on low latitudes.
